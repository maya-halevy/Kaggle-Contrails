# AeroTrace: Identifying Contrails to Reduce Global Warming

#### Group Members: Sasha Baich, Eliott Caen, Maya Halevy

#### Project Description 
Contrails, short for ‘condensation trails’, are line-shaped clouds of ice crystals that form in aircraft engine exhaust that significantly contribute to global warming. There are models based on weather data that are able to identify when contrails will form and how warming they will be. The motivation behind this project is to empirically confirm the predictions from these models. We are working to build a model to detect contrails in satellite images from a labeled image dataset.
